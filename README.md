# LSTM in Finance

This project was developed as part of my **Machine Learning in Finance** course. It explores the application of **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks** for financial time series forecasting.

## Overview

LSTM networks are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that are well-suited for sequential data, making them a powerful tool for predicting stock prices, market trends, or other financial indicators. This project applies LSTMs to financial data to demonstrate their potential in making informed predictions.

## Features

- **Preprocessing financial data**: Cleaning and preparing datasets for modeling.
- **Building an LSTM model**: Implementing and training a neural network for time series forecasting.
- **Evaluating model performance**: Analyzing predictions and assessing accuracy.

## Requirements

To run this project, install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib tensorflow keras scikit-learn
